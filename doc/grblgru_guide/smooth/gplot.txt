1. Install python3 (Windows python3 should come with pip)

2. Open power shell, type the following to install additional modules

   pip install matplotlib
   pip install scipy

3. In power shell, goto the directory containing gplot.py and the g-code files to be processed
   for example "cd $home\cnc\grbl", as mine are stored at $home\cnc\grbl\.  Then type: 

   python -m gplot.py KnobReel2.gc

   which will plot the g-code, where rough cuts are blue lines, while finish cuts in green with dots.

   It's best to enlarge the plot to show more details, but maximize the plot is not recommended.
   As there may be error or warning messages displayed one the PowerShell window.
 
   Use the zoom (magnifying glass) or pan (cross with arrows) button and left mouse button to examine the g-code.

   Sometimes GrblGru generates segments of straight lines in finish cuts which is supposed to be curves.
   To smooth out a region, move mouse and right mouse button to define the region.
   After you click the right button, up to two red lines will show up to indicate the boundary.
   No need for precise position, the red line will snap to closest data point.
   Also, you can continue to use right-clicks to refine the selection.

   After the desired region is selected, press upper case 'S' or 'H' to smooth it out in the horizontal direction.
   The result new curve is displayed as red lines with dots.

   Press upper case 'V' to smooth out in the vertical direction.  This works better if the curve is very steep.

   Only one section of "simple" curve can be smoothed out at a time. Otherwise, gplot will throw an error on PowerShell.

   After a successful curve fit (red lines), a new file "*_N.*" (with the same file extension) will be saved automatically.

   Lower case 's' is the built-in function in Python plot to save the plot.

4. Currently, 'gplot' can only smooth out one region.
   Run run it again on the processed g-code to smooth out a different region, for example:

   python -m gplot.py KnobReel2_1.gc

   Output of the above will be automatically saved as KnobReel2_2.gc. To examine the file: 

   python -m gplot.py KnobReel2_2.gc



* other notes
1. pyinstaller runs, but exe is tagged as virus by windows
2. cxfreeze runs fine, note the long path name !
   C:\Users\User\AppData\Local\Packages\PythonSoftwareFoundation.Python.3.10_qbz5n2kfra8p0\LocalCache\local-packages\Python310\Scripts\cxfreeze.exe -c gplot.py
