All my debug and development notes, way too much details for most users.  Read at your own risk. 

* commands
  rsync -avz --exclude "*.o" --exclude "moc_*" --exclude "ui_*" /home/hjack/cnc/candle/src/* .
* [fixed] font too small (at least on screen size at 1920x1080)
* [fixed] jog button a bit small
* [done] ideally with a scalable screen layout and svg icons for tablet

* 20210904 re-arrnage layout for small touch screen
** main page show 3D view and some basic control buttons
   jog, set X as (display both radius and diameter), set Z as, Run
   open file is handled by menu, not pretty, but ok
** after Run is clicked, should hide/disable Jog/Set-X/Z button, and only Pause and STOP 
   perhaps speed over-ride (feed and rapid), but ok to leave it on a separate tab
** also want to display elapsed time and estimated time
   TODO: estimated time is not very accurate (perhaps not considering accellration and x/z speed difference)
** may want to display DRO/RPM on main page, but not critical
   ezNC shows this already
** TODOS
*** better icons for Jog/Run/Stop

* 20210909 serial port (grbl error) problem [seems fixed]
  happens 1st with rpi3 and ezNC, eventually happened on labtop,
  enable echo and post process log (cat foo.log | ./proc.pl | grep ERROR)
  found a lot more discrepencies, but only few will show up as error
** err on rpi3, happens often
*** no missed char, wrong order ?
G1 X0.341 Y0.000 Z0.336    echo: G10.X341Y0.000Z0.36
G1 X2.600 Y0.000 Z-0.776   echo: G12.6X00Y0.000Z-0.776
*** totally wrong
G1 X0.941 Y0.000 Z0.260    echo  G10.8X00Y0.000Z0.118 ? (err is on previous line, but echoed empty)

** also happens on laptop
  cat cndl_ballhndl.log | ./proc.pl | grep ERROR
*** swap two chars 4-char apart:  X2.800 -> X0.8020

** no problem with uno, esp32 seemed ok, only happens with ezNC 
   move serial port task from core #0 to #1 seems fixed the problem
* TODO
** DONE new control tab: set x/z as (0, user entered number), feed and rapid override
** auto close messgae box ?
** left hand tool
** DONE jog step works in both units
** feedrate in dif units ?
** prhaps, switch unit with G20/G21 when candle changes unit

* BUGS
** happened once, switch back and forth between mm and inch lost some accuracy
   should remember the position instead of convert from 2/3-digits text
** DONE abort made grbl in alarm mode (status was removed by me !)
   add back status report ?
   now checks for alarm state and disable btnRUNSTOP with orange background
   WANT to restart Candle
** occasionally, STOP button is received, but no action
* 20210927 jog not smooth on rpi, but fine on ubuntu
** same setting, labtop ~100  $J/s, but rpi4 only ~10 (or less)/s
   set higher accel and jog speed did not fix rpi jerkiness, further change cpp code to 2x jog step helps
   but only with high speed setting at 1000 (unit?), 300 is still jumpy
** rpi did not stop jog as quickly as ubuntu ?
   force jog stop did not work all the time, occasionally will stall, then cont for a while ?
   want a smooth job even at slow speed !
** observations
   grbl jog cancel may not work, add 100ms delay seems better
   over-kill with flooded jog-cancel ok, but still jerky ?
** tested in garage, cont mode works as expected, but not step mode
   in step mode, jog got canceled when touch is lifted
   also step size depends on unit, should display mm/inch

* 20230225 rpi
** usb auto mout at /media/usb0..3
   sudo apt-get install usbmount
   sudo emacs  /lib/systemd/system/systemd-udevd.service

** samba server
